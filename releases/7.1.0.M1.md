## Known issues / Changes from 7.0.x

### APIs
From 7.0.x to 7.1.x an endpoint from the Runtime Bundle (and also the APIs) was removed to better support the path forward.  The method, from TaskRuntime, 

```
void setVariables(SetTaskVariablesPayload setTaskVariablesPayload);
```
was replaced by,

```
 /**
     * Saves the selected task with the variables set in the payload in the task scope
     * - This method checks that the task is visible by the authenticated user
     * - This method also check that the task is assigned to the currently authenticated user
     */
    void save(SaveTaskPayload saveTaskPayload);
```

Also, the TaskRuntime.delete() method is now returning the Task Status CANCELLED to be coherent with other operations and the reason is updated to  

```
deleteTaskPayload.setReason("Task deleted by " + authenticatedUserId);
```


### HELM Charts
In 7.1.x the notification endpoints in the charts is under *** /notifications ***
