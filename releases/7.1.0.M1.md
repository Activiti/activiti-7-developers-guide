## Known issues / Changes from 7.0.x

### APIs
From 7.0.x to 7.1.x an endpoint from the Runtime Bundle (and also the APIs) was removed to better support the path forward.  The method, from TaskRuntime, 

```
void setVariables(SetTaskVariablesPayload setTaskVariablesPayload);
```
was replaced by,

```
 /**
     * Saves the selected task with the variables set in the payload in the task scope
     * - This method checks that the task is visible by the authenticated user
     * - This method also check that the task is assigned to the currently authenticated user
     */
    void save(SaveTaskPayload saveTaskPayload);
```

Also, the TaskRuntime.delete() method is now returning the Task Status CANCELLED to be coherent with other operations and the reason is updated to  

```
deleteTaskPayload.setReason("Task deleted by " + authenticatedUserId);
```

### REST APIs / Swagger
Now as part of the release each *-starter project also release its SWAGGER JSON/YAML file which can be used to create clients for the services in different programming languages. You can also add them as dependencies to your projects.

Also `/v2/api-docs` endpoint was providing wrong value for mediatype `application/json` and has been fixed. 

Runtime Bundle: 

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.rb</groupId>
  <artifactId>activiti-cloud-starter-runtime-bundle</artifactId>
  <version>7.1.0.M1</version>
  <classifier>api-docs</classifier>
  <type>json</type>
</dependency>
```

Query: 
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.query</groupId>
  <artifactId>activiti-cloud-starter-query</artifactId>
  <version>7.1.0.M1</version>
  <classifier>api-docs</classifier>
  <type>json</type>
</dependency>
```

Audit: 

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.audit</groupId>
  <artifactId>activiti-cloud-starter-audit</artifactId>
  <version>7.1.0.M1</version>
  <classifier>api-docs</classifier>
  <type>json</type>
</dependency>
```

### Connector definition referencing
The way how connector definitions are referenced in the process XML has changed from `connectorId.actionId` to `connectorName.actionName`. If you were referencing connector definitions you need to update the following:
- `implementation` element in the process definition XML. See: https://github.com/Activiti/example-runtime-bundle/pull/207/files
- bean name if it's a local connector. See https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-examples/pull/89/files#diff-5e3e79fa1c3ea97dcacc2de21c75e13aR132
- stream destination name if it's a cloud connenctor. See https://github.com/Activiti/example-cloud-connector/pull/162/files.

Note: nothing change if you're not using connector definition files

### Static values as conector inputs
Add support to static values for connnector inputs inside the variable mappings. Static values can be used to provide extra input to connectors that are not defined in the connector definition. 

```
"mappings": {
      "Task_0h46wzd": {
        
        "inputs": {
          ....
//this is not in the connector definition
          "my-custom-value-name": {
            "type": "static_value",
            "value": "test"
          }
        }
	...

      }
    }
```

Note: It works also for connectors without definition.




### Maven Modules
We splitted the acceptance tests libraries for further refactoring and to make sure that Activiti Cloud and Activiti Cloud Modeling projects are decoupled. For this reason the module called (which was not present in 7.0.0):
```
 <dependency>
	  <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.acc</groupId>
	  <artifactId>activiti-cloud-acceptance-tests-modeling</artifactId>
	</dependency>
```
was now moved to:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.modeling</groupId>
  <artifactId>activiti-cloud-acceptance-tests-modeling</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
And now lives in the Org Service Repository: https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-org-service/

### HELM Charts
In 7.1.x the notification endpoints in the charts is under *** /notifications ***
