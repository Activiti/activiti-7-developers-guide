# 7-EA201712 Early Access release

In the 7-201712-EA release we added improvements to the way cloud connectors manage transactions, which improves their performance. We've added an example based around marketing campaigns for social media content in which you can see how well the connectors perform. The rate of data input and the number of replicas for cloud components in this example can be controlled in the deployment descriptor so that it's easy to play with these variables to test scalability. This example is part of our talk for Alfresco DevCon 2018.

We've also added process model and organisation services, which are preparations for future work that will support logical grouping and editing of BPM models/diagrams.

As part of this release we aligned our artifacts with [Spring Boot 2.0.0.M7](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0.0-M7-Release-Notes) and [Spring Cloud Finchley.M5](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-cloud/wiki/Spring-Cloud-Finchley-Release-Notes).

You can find our published artifacts in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cactiviti-cloud)
and our Docker Images have been tagged so you can use the 7-201712-EA tag for each of our images. You can find more details on
