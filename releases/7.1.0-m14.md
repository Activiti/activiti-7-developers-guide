### In the milestone 7.1.0-M14 you will find the following [main fixes & features](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/milestone/38?closed=1):

* [Split messages containing CloudProcessDeployedEvent](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/issues/3674): Previously, [ ](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud/blob/develop/activiti-cloud-runtime-bundle-service/activiti-cloud-services-runtime-bundle/activiti-cloud-services-events/src/main/java/org/activiti/cloud/services/events/listeners/CloudProcessDeployedProducer.java?rgh-link-date=2021-06-15T16%3A29%3A32Z#L42)the runtime bundle was using a single message to aggregate `PROCESS_DEPLOYED` events for each process definition deployed in the runtime bundle \(including all their versions\). Taking into account that this event is also including the associated process definition file, the message can become very large depending on how many process definitions and how many versions are available for a given runtime bundle.

  In order to avoid large messages, starting from version 7.1.0-M14, `PROCESS_DEPLOYED` events are split into several messages when it's necessary. The default chunk size is 100 events per message, it can be customized by setting the system property `activiti.cloud.runtime-bundle.events-properties.chunk-size` or the environment variable `ACTIVITI_CLOUD_RUNTIMEBUNDLE_EVENTSPROPERTIES_CHUNKSIZE`.  
  In addition to that, the logic has been updated and only the latest version of a given process definition is emmiting events.

* [Add task id on error description for no assignee errors](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/issues/3669).
* [Clear invalid entries from Activiti Cloud Helm Charts](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/issues/3682)
