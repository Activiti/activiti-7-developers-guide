# 7.0.0 Early Access 201709

This release included our first iteration to improve how we handle project dependencies to make our frameworks, services and starters easy to consume. This will also allows us to improve our modularity without affecting people implementations.

The following two BOM (Bill Of Materials \*-dependencies) artefacts were included in this release:

* org.activiti:activiti-dependencies:7-EA201709
* org.activiti.cloud:activiti-cloud-dependencies:7-EA201709

This allows you to include tags in your projects to allow these artefacts manage the correct version for both activiti and activiti-cloud artefacts.

```
<dependencyManagement>
   <dependencies>
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.activiti</groupId>
       <artifactId>activiti-dependencies</artifactId>
       <version>${version.activiti}</version>
       <type>pom</type>
       <scope>import</scope>
     </dependency>
   </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

This release also included our new set of services that provides the core set of functionality for our Cloud Starters. These services now include:

* Audit Service
* Query Service
* Events enabled endpoints and Event Emmitters
* Runtime Bundle Services (Stateless & Inmutable Process Engine)
* Identity Services and integrations

## Cloud Starters

If you are used to work with Spring Boot our Cloud Starters provides a quick way to bootstrap different components in a straight forward way. All these starters are powered with Spring Cloud integration to make sure that they can be configured to leverage the ecosystem that surround them. For example, if there is a Service Registry, these services will be automatically registered to it. If there is an API gateway, these services will be automatically exposed and routes will be created to access them via the Gateway.

You can find our Cloud Starters here: [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-starters](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-starters)

Our Cloud Starters are powered by Spring Boot and the following Spring Cloud projects:

* Spring Cloud Streams
* Spring Cloud Registry
* Spring Cloud Gateway
* Spring Cloud Config (work in progress)
* Spring Cloud Service Connectors (work in progress)
* Spring Cloud Contracts (work in progress)
* Spring Cloud Kubernetes (work in progress)

## Docker Images

Using the starters we have created a set of Docker Images that you can quickly bootstrap the whole infrastructure for you. You can use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to run all these services. Helm Charts are in the process for Kubernetes and we, as developers and as the team in charge of the project, have chosen to use MiniKube for our everyday development environment.

All our Docker images can be configured using Environment Variables to allow different environments, set ups and flexibility on the deployment phase.

## Git Book

We are constantly working in our new Git Book to explain how all these projects and components work together. We understand that Cloud Environments are much more complicated than using a Java Framework and the amount of technology that we will be using in the future might sounds overwhelming. For that reason, our Git Book tries to tackle the frequently asked questions about our architectural decisions and technology choices. This Git Book is going to be a common place for several pieces of documentation related with all our frameworks, services, cloud starters and how all these pieces fits together.

## Examples & Cloud Examples

We are actively working in examples for our projects that you can find here:

Activiti Examples: [https://github.com/activiti/activiti-examples](https://github.com/activiti/activiti-examples) Activiti Cloud Examples: [https://github.com/activiti/activiti-cloud-examples](https://github.com/activiti/activiti-cloud-examples) We will welcome community feedback and help to improve these examples, which are probably the best way to get involved to the project and learn about the new features.
