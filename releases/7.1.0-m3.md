     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.dependencies</groupId>
       <artifactId>activiti-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
       <version>7.1.0.M3.1</version>
       <scope>import</scope>
       <type>pom</type>
     </dependency>
   </dependencies>
 </dependencyManagement>
```

_Activiti Core_

```markup
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.activiti.dependencies</groupId>
        <artifactId>activiti-dependencies</artifactId>

```

In the `7.1.0.M3.1` release you will find the following main fixes & features:

* New common variable mapping logic for connectors, user tasks and subprocesses, with newly defined edge cases, where no mapping that all the variables are gonna be mapped, with same names, to the element whose mapping is missing:

  ```
  "mapping": {}
    
  ```
    
   And existing but empty mapping means that no variables are gonna be mapped to the element with id `taskId`:
   ``` 
   "mapping": { 
       "taskId":{ 
           "inputs": {}, 
           "outputs"t:{} 
       } 
   }
   ```
   If the usual mapping is found for a task inside the process extension file, only  the variables that are mapped will be available to the task.

* Constant values are not part of mappings anymore. They have their own specific field in the extensions.json file associated to a process definition.
    
  _Before 7.1.0.M3.1:_
  ```
  "mappings": {
          "taskId": {
              "inputs": {
                  â€œ_constant_value_": {
                      "type": "static_value",
                      "value": "myConstantValue"
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  ```
  _From 7.1.0.M3.1:_ 
    ```
    "mappings": {},
    "constants" : {
          "taskId": {
            "_constant_value_" : {
              "value": "myConstantValue"
            }
          }
        }
    ```
* Engine support for new BPMN elements: Timers and Inclusive Gateways
