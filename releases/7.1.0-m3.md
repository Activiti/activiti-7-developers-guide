* TBC

You can also deploy our Example HELM charts using your favorite cloud platform \(i.e. AWS, GCP, Azure...\) or on-premise Kubernetes installation by following our [Getting Started Guide](https://activiti.gitbook.io/activiti-7-developers-guide/getting-started/getting-started-activiti-cloud)

### Known issues / Changes from 7.0.x

#### RabbitMQ binder

RabbitMQ binder has been removed as dependency of Activiti Cloud Starters \(`activiti-cloud-starter-runtime-bundle`, `activiti-cloud-starter-query`, `activiti-cloud-starter-audit`, `activiti-cloud-starter-connector`\). 

Now, you need to add the dependency to the binder of your choice along side with related Activiti Cloud Starter. For instance, if you choose RabbitMQ binder you should add:

```markup
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

This will solve the following exception that you may be experimenting after moving to 7.1.0.M2:

```text
org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException: Failed to start bean 'outputBindingLifecycle'; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: A default binder has been requested, but there is no binder available
```

#### Connector names

As the connector names can be used to create pods on kubernetes, these names need to be validated against [DNS-1123](docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E88884/html/kubectl-basics.html) conventions. The regex used in the kubernetes UI itself is "a-z0-9?"

#### Variable mappings

In release 7.1.0.M2 variable mappings have been updated to use names instead of UUIDs:

_Before 7.1.0.M2:_

```text
"mappings": {
    "Task_1spvopd": {
        "inputs": {
          "movieNameUUID": {
            "type": "variable",
            "value": "movieToRankUUID"
          }
        },
        "outputs": {
            "movieDescUUID": {
                "type": "variable",
                "value": "movieDescriptionUUID"
            }
```

_From 7.1.0.M2:_

```text
"mappings": {
    "Task_1spvopd": {
        "inputs": {
          "movieName": {
            "type": "variable",
            "value": "movieToRank"
          }
        },
        "outputs": {
            "movieDesc": {
                "type": "variable",
                "value": "movieDescription"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you're using variable mappings you need to replace process variable and connector input/output UUIDs by the respectif names. You can find names of process variables inside the extension file and names for connector inputs/outputs inside the connector definition file.

#### Helm Charts refactoring

All chart archives are moved to [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-helm-charts](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-helm-charts)   
Full chart located at [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-full-chart](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-full-chart) 

Now full chart has flat structure - application and infrastructure sub charts are removed.  
Common chart is a base chart for all charts and it is located at [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-common-chart](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-common-chart).   
Charts for components located at component folders like: 

* Runtime: [https://github.com/Activiti/example-runtime-bundle/tree/master/charts/runtime-bundle](https://github.com/Activiti/example-runtime-bundle/tree/master/charts/runtime-bundle)  
* Example cloud connector: [https://github.com/Activiti/example-cloud-connector/tree/master/charts/activiti-cloud-connector](https://github.com/Activiti/example-cloud-connector/tree/master/charts/activiti-cloud-connector)
* Audit: [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-audit/tree/master/charts/activiti-cloud-audit](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-audit/tree/master/charts/activiti-cloud-audit)
* Query: [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-query/tree/master/charts/activiti-cloud-query](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-query/tree/master/charts/activiti-cloud-query)

In addition, some of the paths to services has changed:

| Service | New Community URL for full example |
| :--- | :--- |
| Audit | /audit |
| Query | /query |
| Runtime Bundle | /rb |
| Notifications | /notifications |
| Modeling Service | /modeling-service |
| Modeling UI | /modeling |
| KeyCloak | identity.{domain}/auth |
| Gateway | gateway.{domain}/ |
