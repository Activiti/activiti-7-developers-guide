### In the 7.1.0-M7 release you will find the following [main fixes & features](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/milestone/31?closed=1):

* **Error handling for cloud connectors:** see the section [Error handling](../components/activiti-cloud-application/cloud-connectors.md#error-handling) for Cloud Connectors more details.
* Possibility do **explicitly define the variable type** while starting a process via REST API. The variables should be provided in the format `key`/`value` where `key` is going to be the variable name and `value` can be either directly the actual value \(in which case Activiti will try to guess the type\) or a complex object having two fields: `value` with the string representation of the value and `type`  explicitly defining the type. The example below uses a mix of these two options:

```markup
"variables":{
      "dateValue":{
         "type":"date",
         "value":"1970-01-01T01:01:01.001Z"
      },
      "date": "1970-01-01T01:01:01.001Z",
      "stringValue":{
         "type":"string",
         "value":"name"
      },
      "string":"name",
      "bigDecimalValue":{
         "type":"BigDecimal",
         "value":"10.00"
      },
      "intValue":{
         "type":"integer",
         "value":"10"
      },
      "int":10
      "booleanValue":{
         "type":"boolean",
         "value":"true"
      },
      "boolean":true,
      "doubleValue":{
         "type":"double",
         "value":"10.00"
      }
      "double":10.0
   }
```

* Improve information provided by `PROCESS_CANCELLED_EVENT`
* Fix support of `${initiator}` expression.
* Provide candidates info when fetching a task by ID.
* Update to Spring Boot  `2.1.13.RELEASE`.

## Known issues / Changes from previous milestones

* **`jaxb-api` dependency at the engine level:** the dependency to `jaxb-api` was added directly at the engine level, so this extra dependency doesn't need to be declared along side with `activiti-cloud-starter-runtime-bundle`, as in the previous milestones. 
* **Maven artifacts refactoring:** the number of different `groupIds` produced by `Activiti` and `Activiti Cloud` has been reduced to only two \(`org.activiti` and `org.activiti.cloud`\). This is a breaking change compared with previous milestones: `org.activiti.cloud.<suffix>` will become `org.activiti.cloud` and `org.activiti.<suffix>` will become `org.activiti`.
* **Fix semantic versioning:** use `-` character instead of `.`: `7.1.0-M7` and not `7.1.0.M7`.
* **Milestone artifacts are no longer published to Maven Central:**  so far, milestone artifacts are going to be published to Alfresco Nexus.

```

* **Java 8 support has been dropped**
* **Git repositories restructuring:** carrying on the work started in the previous milestone, several git repositories were merged together and so far _Activiti_ projects use only five main repositories:
  * [Activiti](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti): holds **Activiti Core** related code.
  * [activiti-cloud](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud):  holds **Activiti Cloud** related code.
  * [activiti-cloud-application](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-application): holds **Activiti Cloud BoM file** \(`org.activiti.cloud:activiti-cloud-dependencies`\) and example Spring Boot applications used to generate example Docker images.
  * [activiti-modeling-app](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-modeling-app): holds **Activiti Modeling Application** related code.
  * [activiti-cloud-full-chart](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-full-chart): holds **Helm Charts** for Activiti Cloud.
