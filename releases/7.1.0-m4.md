In the 7.1.0.M4 release you will find the following [main fixes & features](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/milestone/21?closed=1):

* Constant values are not part of mappings anymore. They have their own specific field in the `extensions.json` .
* BPMN elements: 
  * Support of Timers \(start, intermediate catch, boundary\) ****and Inclusive Gateways in the Activiti Modeling Application
  * Enhancement of Timers and async tasks execution for Activiti Cloud: jobs are now relying on message broker to distribute the load between the different replicas of the runtime bundle. 

You can also deploy our Example HELM charts using your favorite cloud platform \(i.e. AWS, GCP, Azure...\) or on-premise Kubernetes installation by following our [Getting Started Guide](https://activiti.gitbook.io/activiti-7-developers-guide/getting-started/getting-started-activiti-cloud)

### Known issues / Changes from 7.0.x


**Async executor**

Async executor is now enable by default. It can be disabled by setting the property `spring.activiti.async-executor-activate` to `false`. However async executor should be active to handle timer events and tasks marked as asynchronous.

**Call activity XML extensions**

Support for variables mapping from/to call activity to/from called process has ben removed from XML \(`activiti:in`, `activiti:out`\) in benefit of variables mapping  defined in extensions file.
