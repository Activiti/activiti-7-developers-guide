### In the 7.1.0-M8 release you will find the following [main fixes & features](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/milestone/32?closed=1):

* Add support to BigDecimal for Cloud Connectors and  RestAPI and Rest API: previously, after serializing to JSON, BigDecimal variables were deserialized back to Java as double.
* Add the possibility to retrieve tasks from query service filtered by variable name and variable value. I.e. `GET query/v1/tasks?variables.name=outcome&variables.value=Approve`
* Update to Spring Boot `2.2.8.RELEASE` and Spring Cloud `Hoxton.SR5`

## Known issues / Changes from previous milestones

* In order to handle BigDecimals we needed to change the JSON structure to transfer variables between runtime bundle and Cloud Connectors \(`inBoundVariables` and `outBoundVariables`\) so that it includes the variable type. The Java model is unchanged, however as the JSON structure changes, make sure that the version used for the runtime bundle is aligned with the one used by the connector.

Previous format:

```text
{
    "amount": 10.00
}
```

New format:

```text
{
    "amount": {
        "type": "bigdecimal",
        "value": "10.00"
    }
}
```
