## Changes from previous milestones

### Support Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) on Activiti Cloud full chart.&#x20;

Kubernetes supports horizontal scalability through Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) mechanism.
In `activiti-cloud-full-charts` it is now possible to enable HPA for the `runtime-bundle` and `activiti-cloud-query` microservices.

#### Requirements
The HorizontalPodAutoscaler can fetch metrics from aggregated APIs that, for Kubernetes (metrics.k8s.io), are provided by an add-on named `Metrics Server`.

So, `Metric Server` needs to be installed and launched to use the HPA feature. Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) for its installation.

#### HPA Configuration

In the `activiti-cloud-full-chart` the HorizontalPodAutoscaler is disabled by default for backward compatibility. Please
add the following configuration to your `values.yaml` to enable and use it:

```yaml
runtime-bundle:
  hpa:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 6
    cpu: 90
    memory: "2000Mi"
activiti-cloud-query:
  hpa:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 4
    cpu: 90
```

This configuration (present in the `hpa-values.yaml` file in this repository) enable HPA for both `runtime-bundle` and `activiti-cloud-query`.

> :warning: **WARNING**: the provided values are just an example. Please adjust the values to your specific use case.

##### Configuration Properties

| Name                    | Description                               | Default |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| `enabled`               | enables the HPA feature                   | `false` |
| `minReplicas`           | starting number of replicas to be spawned |         |
| `maxReplicas`           | max number of replicas to be spawned      |         |
| `cpu`                   | +1 replica over this average % CPU value  |         |
| `memory`                | +1 replica over this average memory value |         |
| `scalingPolicesEnabled` | enables the scaling policies              | `true`  |

##### Activiti Cloud Query and HPA

**Activiti Cloud** supports both `RabbitMQ` and `Kafka` message broker. **Activiti Cloud Query** is a consumer of the message broker, so we need to be extra careful in the configuration of the automatic scalability in order to keep it working properly.

As a general rule, the automatic horizontal scalability for the query consumers should be enabled only when the Activiti Cloud has enabled `partitioning`.

##### Activiti Cloud Query and HPA with Kafka

In a partitioned installation, Kafka allows the consumers to connect to one or more partitions with the maximum ratio of 1:1 between partitions and consumers.

So when configuring HPA please **don't** specify the `maxReplicas` value greater than the `partitionCount`.

##### Activiti Cloud Query and HPA with RabbitMQ

When partitioning RabbitMQ the configuration will spawn one replica for every partition, so you should avoid activating the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` in this case.

### Improved Query Event Handling Performance

- [x] Optimized entities hash code and equals to be consistent accross all state transitions using entity identifier 
- [x] Changed Audit entity identity generator to use sequence generator
- [x] Changed Query variable entity identity generator to use sequence generator
- [x] Enabled Hibernate query batching for Audit and Query event handlers
- [x] Optimized Audit event entities to be immutable to avoid extra update queries 
- [x] Optimized Audit event entities to use dynamic insert query behavior
- [x] Optimized Query event entities to use dynamic insert and update query behavior 
- [x] Replaced Spring Data Repository with JPA EntityManager to reduce N+1 queries overhead
- [x] Optimized Query event handler entity graph fetching to reduce N+1 select queries
- [x] Optimized task variables and task created events handling order

#### Query Performance Optimization Results M16 vs M17

##### 7.1.0-M16
- Average Latency: 41ms
- 95p Latency: 62ms
- Throughput: 24tps

##### 7.1.0-M17
- Average Latency: 3.6ms
- 95p Latency: 7ms
- Throughput: 277tps

### Consistency on variables propagation
Previously variables propagation was not consistent between user tasks and service tasks: while user tasks were mapping variables directly from the 
local scope to the process level, service tasks were also updating variables in the execution context before propagating them to the process level. 
This was leading to some misbehaviour depending on the execution order (see https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/issues/3787).

Starting from this release, service tasks are no longer updating the execution context, but updating directly the process instance variables based on the defined mapping.

**Possible side effects:** with the previous implementation, connector outputs were made available to the current execution even in the case where no mapping was defined, 
meaning that connector outputs could be directly used in sequence flow expressions. After this change this will be no longer the case: in order to be able to use 
connector outputs in further expressions you'll need to define a mapping for it (either explicit or using one of `MAP_ALL_OUTPUTS` or `MAP_ALL` options).
