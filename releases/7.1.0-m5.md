   <dependencies>
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.dependencies</groupId>
       <artifactId>activiti-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
       <version>7.1.0.M5</version>
       <scope>import</scope>
       <type>pom</type>
     </dependency>
   </dependencies>
 </dependencyManagement>
```

_Activiti Core_

```markup
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.activiti.dependencies</groupId>
        <artifactId>activiti-dependencies</artifactId>

In the 7.1.0.M5 release you will find the following [main fixes & features:](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/milestone/29?closed=1)

* BPMN elements
  * Add support for multi-instances
  * Cloud Native Bpmn Message Events Support: It includes support for BPMN throw message event. See description of pull request [\#416](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-runtime-bundle-service/pull/416) for more details. In this first iteration message store backend is in memory only and it's not ready for production. The next iteration will bring alternatives for persistent message store backends. It's available thanks to new spring boot starter:

```markup
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.activiti.cloud.rb</groupId>
    <artifactId>activiti-cloud-starter-message-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* Add support for expression on input variable mapping: now it's possible to reference process variables inside an input variable mapping. I.e.":

```text
{
	"inputs": {
          "input-json-template": {
            "type": "value",
            "value": {
              "name": "${name}",
              "age": "${age}",
              "resident": "${resident}"
            }
          }
		}
}
```

`${name}`, `${age}` and `${resident}` will be replaced by the related process variable values before calling the connector.

* Upgrade Spring Boot and Spring cloud versions:
  * Spring boot: 2.1.10.RELEASE
  * Spring cloud: Greenwich.SR3
* Removal of `ComponentScan` on `org.activiti`: in the previous versions _Activiti Core_ and `Activiti Cloud` were relying on `ComponentScan` annotation on the package `org.activiti`. This was causing several issues and misbehaviours. In version `7.1.0.M6` a big work was carried on this level to make sure that we rely on auto configurations only.

## Known issues / Changes from 7.0.x
