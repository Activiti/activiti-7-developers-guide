# Identity Management (IDM)
As most BPM solutions, we require an integration layer between Tasks & Process and the user, groups and roles defined at the organization where you are implementing your solution. For this reason we provide an out of the box integration with Keycloak as our SSO and Identity Management integration layer.
Keycloak opens the door to integrate different systems such as custom database, LDAP, Active Directory and Social Logins.

For IDM and SSO you can find the source code and Docker Image in the following repositories:
- [IDM & SSO -> Source Code](http://)
