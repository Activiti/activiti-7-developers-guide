# Activiti Cloud Modeling

Activiti Cloud Modeling services provide the backend and frontend functionality to support our Activiti Modeler Application.

The backend services are provided by the following Spring Boot Starters:

* [Activiti Cloud Modeling Service](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-modeling-service): provides the organizational structure for your Projects as well as support for storing different models \(such as Process Models, Connector Definitions, etc.\)

The User Interface built with Angular can be [found here](https://github.com/activiti/activiti-modeling-app)

This application uses [BPMN.io](http://bpmn.io) for the BPMN process standard xml generation.
