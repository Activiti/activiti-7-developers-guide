# Activiti Cloud Connectors

Activiti Cloud Connectors provide an scalable way to perform bi-directional system to system interactions. It enable business processes to interact with external systems in a safe way without compromising the process runtime.

**No new frameworks, protocols, or any other crazy stuff was developed to bring Activiti Cloud Connectors to life**

Activiti Cloud Connectors provide:

* A quick way to map and perform a system to system interaction.
* A flexible configuration to support high demand scenarios using well known technology stacks
* A way to version and maintain multiple connectors up and running in the same infrastructure
* A default way to handle your BPMN Service Tasks
* An unified way to trigger actions in our Process Runtimes
* \(Future\) Inter Process Communications: signal/catch/send & receive messages

## Cloud Connector as BPMN Service Task

Cloud Connectors are the default implementation for BPMN Service Tasks when only the attribute `implementation` is defined in the process definition file. The sections below explain how runtime bundle and Cloud Connectors interact.

### Activiti Runtime Bundle side

The Runtime Bundle relies on [Spring Cloud Streams](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) to delegate the service task execution to a Cloud Connector. Once the process execution reaches a _Service Task_, an _Integration Request_ message is sent to a [dynamically bound destination](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#dynamicdestination) having the same name as the one defined in the attribute `implementation` of the related Service Task. For instance, in the following example a message will be sent to the destination `SendRewardToWinners`.

`<serviceTask id="serviceTaskSendReward" name="Tweet Winners" implementation="SendRewardToWinners" />`

After sending the integration request, the Runtime Bundle will wait for the _Integration Result_ sent by the connector once its work is completed. In order to receive the Integration Result back the Runtime Bundle will listen to the input channel named `integrationResultsConsumer`.

The runtime bundle starter \(`activiti-cloud-starter-runtime-bundle`\) will bring the following configuration for the `integrationResultsConsumer` channel:

```text
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.integrationResultsConsumer.destination=integrationResult:${spring.application.name}
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.integrationResultsConsumer.contentType=application/json
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.integrationResultsConsumer.group=${ACT_RB_APP_NAME:my-runtime-bundle}
```

### Cloud Connector side

#### Implementation

In order to implement a Cloud Connector acting as a Service Task we will need:

* Add a dependency to the connector starter:

```text
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.activiti.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>activiti-cloud-starter-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* Define an input channel, using Spring Cloud Stream `@Input` annotation, to receive the Integration Requests coming from the Runtime Bundle. E.g:

```text
public interface RewardMessageChannels {
    String REWARD_CONSUMER = "rewardConsumer";

    @Input(REWARD_CONSUMER)
    SubscribableChannel rewardConsumer();
}
```

* Enable binds for the channel defined in the previous step

```text
@Component
@EnableBinding(RewardMessageChannels.class)
public class SendRewardConnector {
...
}
```

* Implement the connector business logic and send the result back to the Runtime Bundle

```text
    @StreamListener(value = RewardMessageChannels.REWARD_CONSUMER)
    public void tweet(IntegrationRequest event) {

        // business logic goes here

        // build and send result back
        Map<String, Object> results = new HashMap<>();
        Message<IntegrationResult> message = IntegrationResultBuilder.resultFor(event)
                .withVariables(results)
                .buildMessage();

        integrationResultSender.send(message);
    }
```

_Note:_ `IntegrationResultBuilder` and `IntegrationResultSender` \(autowired\) are provided by `activiti-cloud-starter-connector`. `IntegrationResultSender` will use dynamically bound destination again to make sure that the integration result message will be sent to the right destination: `integrationResult:<TARGET_APPLICATION_NAME>`, where `TARGET_APPLICATION_NAME` is the name of the runtime bundle which has sent the initial Integration Request.

#### Configuration

Eventually we'll need to configure the input channel declared above to receive integration requests only for the connector it's intended to. Remember that integration requests are sent to the destination defined by the attribute `implementation` of the related service task. In our example, `SendRewardToWinners`.

```text
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.rewardConsumer.destination=SendRewardToWinners
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.rewardConsumer.contentType=application/json
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.rewardConsumer.group=integration
```

**Important:** note that Cloud Connectors and the Runtime Bundle can \(and probably will\) run into different Spring Boot Applications / containers.
