# Query Service

The Query Service enable client applications to get Process & Task data without going straight to the Runtime Bundles.
The Query Service was designed to enable efficient querying mechanisms for data generated by one or more Runtime Bundles.
In contrast with the Audit Service, the Query Service picks up the event and apply some transformations to store state.

This component was designed to aggregate data from a set of related Runtime Bundles, allowing consumers to filter using the runtime bundle.

## Specification


## Endpoints
The query component provides two different endpoints
- REST HAL APIs
- GraphQL Endpoint

## GraphQL Query Endpoint

The GraphQL Query API provides single entry GraphQL query endpoint at `/graphql` URI with support for expressive process entity schema and type-safe query criteria expressions in order to execute flexible, fast and declarative data queries for consumer applications.

### Supported HTTP Methods, Headers, and Body
Activiti GraphQL Rest Controller handles both HTTP GET and POST method requests.

#### GET requests

When receiving an HTTP GET request, the GraphQL query should be specified in the `query` parameter. For example, if we wanted to execute the following GraphQL query:
```
{
  ProcessInstance(processInstanceId:1) {
    processInstanceId
    tasks {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
This request could be sent via an HTTP GET like so:

`http://server:port/admin/graphql?query={ProcessInstance(processInstanceId:"1"){processInstanceId,tasks{id,name}}}`

Query variables can be sent as a JSON-encoded string in an additional query parameter called `variables`.

#### POST requests

A standard GraphQL POST request uses the application/json content type, and includes a JSON-encoded body of the following form:
```
{
  "query": "{ProcessInstance(processInstanceId:\"1\"){processInstanceId,tasks{id,name}}}",
  "variables": { "processInstanceId": "value" }
}
```
The field `variables` is optional.

In addition to the above, `ActivitiQraphQLController` supports the following cases:

- If the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` Content-Type header is present in the POST request, the GraphQL query should be specified in the `query` parameter string. Query variables can be sent as a JSON-encoded string in an additional query parameter called `variables`.

- If the "application/graphql" Content-Type header is present, treat the HTTP POST body contents as the GraphQL query string.

#### QraphQL Query Response

Regardless of the method by which the query and variables were sent, the response is returned in the body of the request in JSON format.

```
{
  "data": {
    "ProcessInstance": {
      "processInstanceId": "1",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "4",
          "name": "task4",
        },
        {
          "id": "5",
          "name": "task5",
          "assignee": "assignee",
          "status": "Completed",
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "errors": [ ]
}
```
If there were no errors returned, the "errors" field will be empty in the response object.

### GraphQL Query Schema

Activiti GraphQL query endpoint provides schema descriptions derived from JPA entity model at runtime for the following entities: `ProcessInstance`, `Task`, and `Variable`. The schema also derives GraphQL scalar types from JPA entity model attributes to validate provided variable values against the schema.

Each entity in the query model is wrapped into two GraphQL query fields, i.e. ProcessInstance entity will have two representations in the GraphQL schema:

- One that models the entity directly using singular form, i.e. `ProcessInstance` or `Task` to query single entity instance by `id` argument.
- One that wraps the entity in a pagable query request with `where` criteria expression using Entity pluralized form, i.e. `ProcessInstances` or `Tasks`

For example, you can use singular query wrapper, if you need a single object as root of your query:

    query {
      ProcessInstance(processInstanceId:"1") {
        processInstanceId
        tasks {
          id
          name
          assignee
          status
        }
      }
    }

Will return:

    {
      "ProcessInstance": {
        "processInstanceId": "1",
        "tasks": [
          {
            "id": "4",
            "name": "task4",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Running"
          },
          {
            "id": "5",
            "name": "task5",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Completed"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

### GraphQL Pluralized Query Wrapper with Where Criteria Expressions

This GraphtQL schema supports flexible type safe criteria expressions with familiar SQL query syntax semantics using `where` arguments int the `select` query field to use any combination of logical expressions like `OR`, `AND`, `EQ`, `NE`, `GT`, `GE`, `LT`, `LR`, `IN`, `NIN`, `IS_NULL`, `NOT_NULL` provided by SQL query language.

For example, the following query will find all running process instances with completed tasks:

    query {
      ProcessInstances(where: {
        OR: {
          status: { LIKE: "Running"}
        }
      }) {
        select {
          processInstanceId
          status
          tasks(where: {status: {EQ: "Completed"}}) {
            id
            name
            assignee
            status
          }
        }
      }
    }

Will return

    {
      "ProcessInstances": {
        "select": [
          {
            "processInstanceId": "0",
            "status": "Running",
            "tasks": [
              {
                "id": "1",
                "name": "task1",
                "assignee": "assignee",
                "status": "Completed"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "processInstanceId": "1",
            "status": "Running",
            "tasks": [
              {
                "id": "5",
                "name": "task5",
                "assignee": "assignee",
                "status": "Completed"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

### GraphQL Reverse Query

You can execute an inverse query to fitler results with a join in many-to-one association.

For Example:

    query {
      Tasks {
        select {
          name
          assignee
          status
          processInstance(where: {processInstanceId: {EQ: "1"}}) {
            processInstanceId
            status
          }
          variables {
            name
            type
            value
          }
        }
      }
    }

Will return result:

    {
      "Tasks": {
        "select": [
          {
            "name": "task4",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Running",
            "processInstance": {
              "processInstanceId": "1",
              "status": "Running"
            },
            "variables": [
              {
                "name": "variable5",
                "type": "String",
                "value": "value5"
              },
              {
                "name": "variable6",
                "type": "String",
                "value": "value6"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "task5",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Completed",
            "processInstance": {
              "processInstanceId": 1,
              "status": "Running"
            },
            "variables": []
          }
        ]
      }
    }

### GraphQL Paged Queries

Use plural query wrapper with Where Criteria Expressions to run complex queries with paged collection results and request total records and pages counts:

    query {
      ProcessInstances(page: {start:1, limit:1}) {
        pages
        total
        select {
          processInstanceId
          tasks {
            id
            name
            assignee
            status
          }
        }
      }
    }

The result will be:

    {
      "ProcessInstances": {
        "pages": 2,
        "total": 2,
        "select": [
          {
            "processInstanceId": 0,
            "tasks": [
              {
                "id": "2",
                "name": "task2",
                "assignee": "assignee",
                "status": "Running"
              },
              {
                "id": "3",
                "name": "task3",
                "assignee": "assignee",
                "status": "Running"
              },
              {
                "id": "1",
                "name": "task1",
                "assignee": "assignee",
                "status": "Completed"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

To optimize query performance, the GraphQL Query DataFetcher implementation will execute an extra query to get the total elements only if you have requested 'pages' or 'total' fields.

### GraphQL Query Sorting

Sorting is supported on any field.  Simply pass in an 'orderBy' argument with the value of ASC or DESC in the query field attribute.  Here's an example of sorting by name for Task objects. If sort order is not specified and there is no field with default sort order provided, query data fetcher use the identity field for default sorting in order to avoid paging confusions.

For Example:

    query {
      Tasks {
        select {
          id
          name(orderBy:DESC)
          assignee
          status
        }
      }
    }

Will Return:

    {
      "Tasks": {
        "select": [
          {
            "id": "5",
            "name": "task5",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Completed"
          },
          {
            "id": "4",
            "name": "task4",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Running"
          },
          {
            "id": "3",
            "name": "task3",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Running"
          },
          {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "task2",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Running"
          },
          {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "task1",
            "assignee": "assignee",
            "status": "Completed"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

### Variable Parameter Bindings

Just like a REST API, it is possible to pass arguments to an endpoint in a GraphQL API. By declaring the arguments in the query defintion, typechecking happens automatically. Each argument must be named with `$` prefix, have a type. To use variable, simply reference it in any criteria expressions inside query statements. Each argument's value will be resolved during query execution pipeline.

    {
       "query": "query filterByStatus($status: String!) {
          ProcessInstances(where: {
            OR: {
              status: { LIKE: $status}
            }
          }) {
            select {
              processInstanceId
              status
              tasks(where: {status: {EQ: \"Completed\"}}) {
                id
                name
                assignee
                status
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ",
       "variables":{"status":"Running"}
    }

### GraphQL Query Performance
-----------
The Activiti GraphQL Data Fetcher implementation will build dynamic JPA fetch graph in order to minimize the number of queries executed against database in order to avoid 1+N lazy loading problems.

### How to demo Activiti GraphQL Query API

The GraphiQL browser (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) can be used for simple testing. It provides schema documentation browser and query builder with auto-completion support, as well as parameter bindings.

TODO: Provide link to the demo application...

Then, navigate to http://host:port/graphiql.html to load GraphiQL browser. The collapsed Docs panel can opened by clicking on the button in the upper right corner to expose current test schema models.

You can run GraphQL queries in the left pannel. Type the query and hit the run button. The results should come up in the middle
panel. If your query has variables, there is a minimized panel at the bottom left.  Simply click on this to expand, and
type in your variables as a JSON string with quoted keys.

## Event Listeners
The query service listen to events generated by runtime bundles and transform them to store state about the current process instances and tasks executions. This state is stored in a schema that is optimized for querying and based on the specification of this component different implementations using different technologies can be implemented.

Our reference implementation uses JPA entities to store this state and we defined a simple schema to store 3 entities:
- [ProcessInstance](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/blob/master/activiti-services/activiti-services-query/activiti-services-query-model/src/main/java/org/activiti/services/query/model/ProcessInstance.java)
- [Task](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/blob/master/activiti-services/activiti-services-query/activiti-services-query-model/src/main/java/org/activiti/services/query/model/Task.java)
- [Variable](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/blob/master/activiti-services/activiti-services-query/activiti-services-query-model/src/main/java/org/activiti/services/query/model/Variable.java)

## Security and Permissions

By default only admin users can access everything. The endpoints that begin with /admin/ can be opened up by passing the role 'user' as the value of the ACTIVITI_ADMIN_ROLE environment variable.

Process instance, task and variable data can also be restricted to particular users or roles. This can be done by adding properties such as:

activiti.cloud.security.user.testuser.rb-app-name.policy.read=defKey1
activiti.cloud.security.user.hruser.rb-app-name.policy.read=defKey2

Here rb-app-name is the name of a runtime bundle application. Or environment variables can be used such as

`ACTIVITI_CLOUD_SECURITY_USER_HRUSER_RBMYAPP_POLICY_READ=SimpleProcess`
