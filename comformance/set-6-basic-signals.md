## Scenario Set 6: Signals
- [Process throwing a signal event]()
  - Start Operation:
    - PROCESS_CREATED
    - PROCESS_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - SEQUENCE_FLOW_TAKEN
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - SEQUENCE_FLOW_TAKEN
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - PROCESS_COMPLETED


- [Process with signal intermediate catch event]()
  - We should have the following events after starting this process (process is waiting for matching signal):
  - Start Operation
    - PROCESS_CREATED
    - PROCESS_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - SEQUENCE_FLOW_TAKEN
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
  - Signal Operation:
    - We should have the following events after a matching signal is sent:
    - SIGNAL_RECEIVED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - SEQUENCE_FLOW_TAKEN
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - PROCESS_COMPLETED

- [Process with signal boundary event]()
  - We should have the following events after starting the process
  - Start Operation
    - PROCESS_CREATED
    - PROCESS_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - SEQUENCE_FLOW_TAKEN
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - TASK_CREATED
  - We should have the following events after sending a signal matching with  boundary signal event:
  - Signal Operation
    - SIGNAL_RECEIVED
    - TASK_CANCELLED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - SEQUENCE_FLOW_TAKEN
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - TASK_CREATED

- [Signal start event]()
  - We should have the following events when a signal matching the signal start event is sent:
  - Signal Operation
    - SIGNAL_RECEIVED
    - PROCESS_CREATED
    - PROCESS_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - SEQUENCE_FLOW_TAKEN
    - ACTIVITY_STARTED
    - ACTIVITY_COMPLETED
    - PROCESS_COMPLETED
