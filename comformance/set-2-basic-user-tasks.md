- [User Task with Candidate Group](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20CandidateGroup.bpmn20.xml) 
  - We should be able to start the process and check that the Status after start is RUNNING

- [User Task with Candidate Group Claim & Release Task](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20CandidateGroup.bpmn20.xml)
  - We should be able to start the process and check that the Status after start is RUNNING
  - This process instance has no concrete assignee
  - We should query for the tasks for the candidate user and check that we get just one task
  - We should check that User2 doesn’t have any task
  - We should be able to get the task by id using User1 
  - We should check that User2 cannot get the task by id

  - User3 and User1 should be able to see the task again after release

- [User Task without Assignments](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20no%20User%20or%20Group%20Assignment.bpmn20.xml) 
  - We should be able to start the process and check that the Status after start is RUNNING
  - Neither User1 or User2 should be able to see any task, due the task has no assignee, candidateUser or candidateGroup
  - A user with **ACTIVITI_ADMIN** role should be able to see the task, but more on Admins later

- [User Task For Assignee Delete](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20Assignee.bpmn20.xml)
  - A process creates a task and the user execute delete on it
  - The user is the assignee of the task, so no need to claim
  - Calling delete on a task that belongs to a process should produce an ActivitiException: “The task cannot be deleted because is part of a running process”

- [User Task For Candidate Delete](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20CandidateUser.bpmn20.xml) 
  - A process creates a task and the user execute delete on it
  - The user is the candidate of the task
  - Calling delete on a task that belongs to a process should produce an **ActivitiException**

- [User Task Details]() TBD


- [User Task With Data / Variables]() TBD
