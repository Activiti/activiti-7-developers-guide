# Getting Started - Activiti Docker Compose

Follow this guide to setup Docker Compose to run Activiti Cloud on your local computer in Docker VM. 

## Hardware Setup

You will need to allocate at least 4 CPU cores and 8 Gb of RAM for your Docker VM machine. 

## Software Setup

Before you start, the following packages must be installed:

  * Docker for Desktop [Docker web site](https://www.docker.com/) or [Docker Toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases) for your OS 
  * Docker-compose [Docker-compose page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you use Docker for Desktop. 
  * GNU Make. For Linux and Mac it is usually installed already, for Windows follow [Chocolatey GNU Make](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make) to install Make.
  * Git Bash Terminal . For Linux and Ma—Å it is usually pre-installed. For Windows, follow [Chocolatey Git Install](https://chocolatey.org/packages/git.install) to install Git Bash Terminal.

## Clone Activiti Cloud Examples 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-examples
cd docker-compose
```

## Configure Your Environment

You need to edit `.env` file to configure DOCKER_IP property based on your OS and Docker VM type. 

* Use your local computer IP address for Docker for Desktop on Linux, Mac or Windows
* Use `docker-machine ip` command if you use Docker Toolbox

Then use _activiti_ as default environment. <br>
To start work execute _getKeycloakToken hruser_ in Postman Keycloak collection. Then run startProcess in rb-my-app Postman collection.
