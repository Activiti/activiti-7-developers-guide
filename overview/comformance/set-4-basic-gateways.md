# BPMN Comformance Set 4

* [Exclusive Gateway with two User Tasks assigned to User 1 and User 2](set-4-basic-gateways.md)
  * Due a simple expression User 1 should see a task created after the exclusive gateway
* [Exclusive Gateway with Expression Error](set-4-basic-gateways.md)
  * It should fail at deployment time
  * For now we see an exception after the gateway is executed. The exception is reported by the first sequence flow that fails.
* [Parallel Gateway with two User Tasks assigned to User 1 and User 2](set-4-basic-gateways.md)
  * User 1 should see a task assigned after the parallel gateway
  * User 2 should see a task assigned after the parallel gateway
  * User 3 shouldnâ€™t see any task
* [Parallel Gateway with two User Tasks assigned to Group 1 and Group 2](set-4-basic-gateways.md)
  * User 1 should see a task created after the parallel gateway
  * User 2 should see a task created after the parallel gateway
