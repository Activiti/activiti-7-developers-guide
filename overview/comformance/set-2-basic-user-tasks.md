# BPMN Comformance Set 2

This scenario checks User Tasks and basic assignments properties. It also check the events generated by the Task Runtime. Task Operations are used to interact against Task resources. The [source code of these tests can be found here](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/tree/develop/activiti-spring-conformance-tests/activiti-spring-conformance-set2).

* [User Task with User Assignment](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20Assignee.bpmn20.xml) 
  * We should be able to start the process and check that the Status after start is RUNNING
  * This process instance has a concrete assignee: “user1”
  * We should query for the tasks for the assigned user and check that we get just one task
  * We should check that User2 doesn’t have any task

  * We should be able to start the process and check that the Status after start is RUNNING
  * This process instance has no concrete assignee
  * We should query for the tasks for the candidate group Group1, User1 and User3 get one task
  * We should check that User2 doesn’t have any task
  * We should be able to get the task by id using User1 and User3
  * We should check that User2 cannot get the task by id

* [User Task without Assignments](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20no%20User%20or%20Group%20Assignment.bpmn20.xml)
  * We should be able to start the process and check that the Status after start is RUNNING
  * Neither User1 or User2 should be able to see any task, due the task has no assignee, candidateUser or candidateGroup
  * A user with **ACTIVITI\_ADMIN** role should be able to see the task, but more on Admins later
* [User Task For Assignee Delete](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20Assignee.bpmn20.xml)
  * A process creates a task and the user execute delete on it
  * The user is the assignee of the task, so no need to claim
  * Calling delete on a task that belongs to a process should produce an ActivitiException: “The task cannot be deleted because is part of a running process”
* [User Task For Candidate Delete](https://github.com/salaboy/bpmn-scenarios/blob/master/processes/UserTask%20with%20CandidateUser.bpmn20.xml)
  * A process creates a task and the user execute delete on it
  * The user is the candidate of the task
  * Calling delete on a task that belongs to a process should produce an **ActivitiException**
* [User Task Details](set-2-basic-user-tasks.md) TBD
* [User Task With Data / Variables](set-2-basic-user-tasks.md) TBD
